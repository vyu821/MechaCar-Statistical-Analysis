# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Challenge Overview
You are to:
- perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Resources
- MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_coil.csv, mpg dataset in ggplot2
- Software: R 4.0.3, Visual Studio Code 1.47.2

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression](images/lm.png)

Looking at the summary of the linear regression, we can see that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on predicting mpg. This is because their respective Pr(>|t|) values are less than .05.

The slope of the linear model is considered to be not 0 because our p-value is less than our assumed significance level of .05.

This linear model is moderately effective at predicting mpg of MechaCar prototypes as indicated by the R-squared value of .7149, or 71.49%.
